Download Visual Sudios Community and make sure to select
c++ stuff when installing.

Open Developers Command Prompt when it's installed and
navigate to the directory that has MaxUp.c example:
cd C:/MaxUp

Compile your c code:
cl maxup.c

Opening/Editing the MaxUp.c file:
You can edit the c file with notepad or notepad++ just
select open in notepad and next to the file name drop down
select all files so it will show the file in the directory.

Or you can just right click the file MaxUp.c and use
open with option to open the c file.

Lastly:
Double click the MaxUp.exe program and have fun.

I compiled this in 65bit im not sure if it will work with
x86 computers but you can try.
